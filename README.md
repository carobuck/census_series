## This is a WIP repository to gather my thoughts and write about the 
census, from a data POV. Maybe this will be one big article, maybe it'll 
be a TED Talk, maybe it'll be a zine series. TBD.

I'll add interesting links and details to this once the project gets more 
interesting/organized/formalized.
